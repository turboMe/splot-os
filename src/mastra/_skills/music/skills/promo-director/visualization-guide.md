## Color Theory

**How colors are extracted:**

1. Dominant color: Most saturated color from album artwork (filtered to avoid black/white)
2. Complementary color: Opposite on color wheel (180° hue rotation), boosted saturation/lightness
3. Analogous colors: ±30° on color wheel (used in "dual" style)

**Which styles use colors:**

**Artwork colors:**
- pulse (complementary)
- mirror (complementary)
- mountains (complementary)
- colorwave (complementary)
- neon (complementary)
- dual (dominant + complementary)

**Fixed colors (white):**
- bars
- line
- circular

**Why use white:**
- Universal compatibility (works with any artwork)
- Maximum contrast on dark background
- Classic "visualizer" aesthetic
- Less processing (faster rendering)

## Performance Considerations

**Rendering speed (slowest to fastest):**

1. **circular** - Most complex (vectorscope calculations)
2. **dual** - Two waveform passes
3. **pulse** - Three blur layers + blending
4. **mountains** - Frequency analysis + multiple processing steps
5. **mirror** - Split + flip + blur
6. **neon** - Two layers + blur
7. **colorwave** - Two layers + blur
8. **bars** - Frequency analysis only
9. **line** - Simplest (single waveform pass)

**Typical rendering times (15s video):**
- Fast (line, bars): ~20-30 seconds
- Medium (colorwave, neon, mirror): ~30-45 seconds
- Slow (pulse, mountains, dual): ~45-60 seconds
- Very slow (circular): ~60-90 seconds

**Batch processing (10 tracks):**
- Fast styles: ~5-7 minutes total
- Medium styles: ~7-10 minutes total
- Slow styles: ~10-15 minutes total

## Customization

**To add custom style:**

Edit `tools/promotion/generate_promo_video.py`:

```python
elif style == "custom":
    viz_filter = f"""[0:a]showwaves=s={WIDTH}x{viz_height}:mode=cline:scale=sqrt:colors={color2}:rate={FPS}[wave]"""
```

**Parameters to adjust:**

- `mode`: cline (centered line), line (from bottom), p2p (peak-to-peak)
- `scale`: sqrt (balanced), lin (linear), log (logarithmic), cbrt (cubic root)
- `colors`: Hex color (0xRRGGBB)
- `rate`: Frame rate (30 recommended)
- `gblur sigma`: Blur amount (2-25, higher = more blur)
- `blend mode`: screen (additive light), addition (brighter), normal

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Instagram Reels:**
- Prefer pulse, bars, or neon (high energy)
- Avoid circular (too abstract for Instagram audience)
- Short attention span: reactivity matters

**Twitter:**
- Prefer pulse or colorwave (professional)
- Avoid overly complex styles (small preview thumbnails)
- Clean, readable aesthetic works best

**TikTok:**
- Prefer bars, pulse, or neon (gen-z aesthetic)
- High energy, attention-grabbing
- Avoid minimal styles (line, mirror)

**Artist website:**
- Any style works
- Consider matching to album aesthetic
- Circular or dual for art/experimental projects

## Examples by Use Case

**"I want maximum attention on Instagram"**
→ Use `neon` or `pulse` - High energy, bright, eye-catching

**"I want professional, polished promo for Twitter"**
→ Use `pulse` or `colorwave` - Clean, refined, modern

**"I want to show off my artwork colors"**
→ Use `pulse`, `dual`, or `colorwave` - Extracts colors from art

**"I want classic visualizer aesthetic"**
→ Use `bars` or `line` - Timeless, recognizable

**"I want something unique and different"**
→ Use `circular` or `dual` - Stands out, memorable

**"I want fast rendering for quick turnaround"**
→ Use `line` or `bars` - Fastest render times

**"I want ambient, chill vibe"**
→ Use `mirror` or `mountains` - Soft, meditative

## Testing Recommendations

**Before batch-generating all tracks:**

1. Generate one test video with your preferred style
2. View on phone (most common viewing device)
3. Check:
   - Waveform reactivity (too much/too little?)
   - Color scheme (matches album aesthetic?)
   - Readability (title/artist clear?)
   - Artwork visibility (not obscured by waveform?)
4. Adjust if needed, then batch-generate all tracks

**Quick test via MCP:**
```
generate_promo_videos(album_slug, style="pulse", track_filename="01-track-name.wav")
```

## Advanced Techniques

**Combine multiple videos:**

For variety, use different styles per track:
- Intros/outros: line or mirror (minimal)
- Choruses: pulse or neon (high energy)
- Bridges: colorwave or mountains (transitional)

**Style progression:**

For album sampler, consider style transitions:
- Start calm: mirror → colorwave
- Build energy: pulse → bars → neon
- Peak intensity: dual or circular
- Wind down: colorwave → line

**Match tempo:**

Some styles work better with tempo:
- Fast (140+ BPM): bars, neon, pulse
- Medium (90-140 BPM): pulse, colorwave, line
- Slow (<90 BPM): mirror, mountains, line
