# Mastra Musician Port

This is a Mastra musician-domain port of the CC0 `explicit-checker` skill from `bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills`. Use the craft guidance below, but obey the local runtime contract first.

## Local Runtime Rules

- Use the music project store and tools: `music_start_project`, `music_set_brief`, `music_write_lyrics`, `music_compile_prompt_spec`, `music_lint_prompt`, `music_check_safety`, `music_generate`, and `music_record_take`.
- Do not use bitwize album directories, MCP tools, slash commands, or filesystem state conventions.
- Before surface-specific prompt wording, load `[ref:grammar/surface-grammar-adapter]`. The default style prompt is natural-language prose for the active surface, not a universal Suno Style Box.
- Convert named artists, bands, real voices, and soundalikes into descriptive genre, era, instrumentation, arrangement, and production language before any paid generation.
- Treat support files as local references loaded through `music_load_reference`; do not assume they are already in context.

## Supporting Files

No supporting files were present in the source skill.

## Ported Craft Guidance

# Explicit Content Checker

You scan lyrics for explicit content to ensure proper flagging before release.

---

## Explicit Words (Require Explicit = Yes)

These words and variations require the explicit flag:

| Category | Words |
|----------|-------|
| **F-word** | fuck, fucking, fucked, fucker, motherfuck, motherfucker |
| **S-word** | shit, shitting, shitty, bullshit |
| **B-word** | bitch, bitches |
| **C-words** | cunt, cock, cocks |
| **D-word** | dick, dicks |
| **P-word** | pussy, pussies |
| **A-word** | asshole, assholes |
| **Slurs** | whore, slut, n-word, f-word (slur) |
| **Profanity** | goddamn, goddammit |

---

## Clean Words (No Explicit Flag Needed)

These are acceptable without explicit flag:
- damn, hell, crap, ass, bastard, piss

Note: "damn" alone is clean, but "goddamn" is explicit.

---

## Override Support

The local music tooling `check_explicit_content` tool automatically loads and merges user overrides from `{overrides}/explicit-words.md`. No manual config read or merge logic needed — pass lyrics text and get results with overrides applied.

### Override File Format

**`{overrides}/explicit-words.md`:**
```markdown
# Custom Explicit Words

## Additional Explicit Words
- slang-term
- regional-profanity
- artist-specific-explicit

## Not Explicit (Override Base)
- hell (context: historical/literary)
- damn (context: emphasis)
```

---

## Workflow

### For Album Path

1. Call `list_tracks(album_slug)` — get all tracks with metadata
2. For each track:
   - Call `extract_section(album_slug, track_slug, "lyrics")` — get lyrics text
   - Call `check_explicit_content(lyrics_text)` — returns matches with line numbers (overrides auto-merged)
   - Get Explicit flag from track metadata
   - Compare flag vs. content
3. Generate report

### For Single Track

1. Call `extract_section(album_slug, track_slug, "lyrics")` — get lyrics text
2. Call `check_explicit_content(lyrics_text)` — scan for explicit words
3. Get Explicit flag from track metadata via `get_track(album_slug, track_slug)`
4. Report findings

## Output Format

```
EXPLICIT CONTENT SCAN
Album: [Album Name]
Date: [Scan Date]

TRACK RESULTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Track 01: [Title]
  Flag: No
  Content: Clean
  Status: ✓ OK

Track 02: [Title]
  Flag: Yes
  Content: fuck (3), shit (2), bitch (1)
  Status: ✓ OK (flag matches content)

Track 03: [Title]
  Flag: No
  Content: fuck (1)
  Status: ⚠️ MISMATCH - Contains explicit content but flag is No

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SUMMARY:
  Total tracks: 10
  Clean tracks: 7
  Explicit tracks: 3
  Mismatches: 1

ALBUM EXPLICIT FLAG: Yes (any track explicit = album explicit)

ACTION REQUIRED:
  - Track 03: Set Explicit flag to Yes
```

---

## Mismatch Detection

### Flag Says No, Content Is Explicit
```
⚠️ MISMATCH: Track contains explicit content but Explicit flag is "No"
ACTION: Set Explicit: Yes in track file
```

### Flag Says Yes, Content Is Clean
```
ℹ️ NOTE: Track flagged explicit but no explicit words found
This is OK - artist may want explicit flag for themes/context
No action required (conservative flagging is fine)
```

## Distributor Requirements

Most distributors (DistroKid, TuneCore, CD Baby) require:
- **Track-level flags**: Each track marked explicit or clean
- **Album-level flag**: If ANY track is explicit, album is explicit
- **Consistent metadata**: Flag must match actual content

**Consequences of wrong flags**:
- Explicit content marked clean → Potential removal from platforms, account issues
- Clean content marked explicit → Reduced reach (filtered from some playlists) but no penalty

**Rule**: When in doubt, mark explicit. Under-flagging is worse than over-flagging.

---

## Integration

This skill is called during:
1. **Ready to Generate Checkpoint** - Before music generation
2. **Album Completion Checklist** - Before release
3. **Manual review** - Anytime with `/explicit-checker [path]`

---

## Example Invocations

```
/explicit-checker artists/[artist]/albums/rock/dark-tide/
/explicit-checker artists/[artist]/albums/rock/dark-tide/tracks/01-the-tank.md
```

---

## Remember

- Case-insensitive matching (Fuck = fuck = FUCK)
- Check variations (fucking, fucked, fucker)
- Phonetic spellings count (fuk, sh1t if intentional)
- Context matters less than presence - if the word is there, flag it
- Album is explicit if ANY track is explicit
- **Override additions** - Add artist/genre-specific explicit words
- **Override removals** - Remove words for specific contexts (historical, literary)
