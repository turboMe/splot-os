# Genre-Specific Mastering Presets

Quick reference for choosing the right mastering settings by genre.

---

## How Genre Presets Work

The `--genre` flag applies:
1. **Target LUFS** - Genre-appropriate loudness
2. **High-mid EQ cut** - Reduces harshness at 3.5kHz
3. **High shelf cut** - Optional cut above 8kHz

```bash
python3 {plugin_root}/tools/mastering/master_tracks.py {audio_path}/ --genre rock
```
