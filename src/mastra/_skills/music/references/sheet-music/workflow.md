# Sheet Music Generation Workflow

Complete guide for converting mastered audio to publishing-quality piano reductions.

## Overview

**Pipeline**: WAV → AnthemScore CLI (automated) → MusicXML/PDF → MuseScore (polish) → Final PDF

**Time estimate**:
- Automated batch: ~30-60 seconds per track
- Manual polish in MuseScore: 5-30 minutes per track (if needed)

**Accuracy expectation**: 70-95% depending on arrangement density

---

## Quick Start (Automated)

```bash
# Batch transcribe all WAVs in a folder
./tools/sheet-music/transcribe.sh /path/to/mastered/

# Single track
./tools/sheet-music/transcribe.sh /path/to/track.wav

# PDF only (skip MusicXML)
./tools/sheet-music/transcribe.sh /path/to/mastered/ --pdf-only

# With MIDI files
./tools/sheet-music/transcribe.sh /path/to/mastered/ --midi
```

**Output**: Creates `sheet-music/source/` folder with PDFs, MusicXML, and MIDI files.

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation

**Select tracks to transcribe**:
- Melodic tracks work best (clear vocal/instrumental lines)
- Avoid dense electronic arrangements
- Consider which tracks benefit from sheet music (licensing, covers)

**Organize source files**:
```
album/
├── mastered/                    # Source WAVs
│   ├── 01-track.wav
│   └── 02-track.wav
└── sheet-music/                 # Output location
    ├── source/                  # AnthemScore output (auto-created)
    ├── singles/                 # Clean-titled consumer files
    │   └── .manifest.json
    └── songbook/                # Combined songbook PDF
```

### Phase 2: Transcription in AnthemScore

**Opening the file**:
1. Launch AnthemScore
2. File → Open
3. Select mastered WAV file
4. Wait for initial analysis (30-60 seconds)

**Understanding the interface**:
- **Spectrogram** (top): Frequency over time - bright = loud
- **Keyboard** (left): Piano roll visualization
- **Staff** (bottom): Generated notation

**Adjusting transcription**:

| Setting | Purpose | Typical Value |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Note Sensitivity | More/fewer notes detected | Start at 50%, adjust |
| Min Note Length | Filter short notes | 0.1-0.2 seconds |
| Instrument | Target transcription type | Piano |

**Sensitivity tuning**:
- Too high: Ghost notes (false positives)
- Too low: Missing notes
- Find the sweet spot where melody is clear

**Manual corrections**:
- Click notes to select
- Delete key removes notes
- Click + drag to add notes
- Adjust duration by dragging edges

**Export**:
1. File → Export As → MusicXML (.musicxml)
2. Also export PDF for reference
3. Also export MIDI for playback verification

### Phase 3: Polish in MuseScore

**Import**:
1. File → Open
2. Select MusicXML file
3. Review import settings (usually defaults are fine)

**Essential checks**:

| Check | How to Fix |
|-------|------------|
| Key signature | Edit → Key Signature (or K shortcut) |
| Time signature | Edit → Time Signature (or T shortcut) |
| Tempo | Add → Text → Tempo Marking |
| Clef | Right-click staff → Staff/Part Properties |

**Notation cleanup**:
- Fix note durations (select note, use number keys 4-7)
- Add rests to complete measures
- Tie notes that should be connected
- Beam/unbeam eighth notes appropriately

**Performance markings**:
- Dynamics: Add → Dynamics (p, mf, f)
- Articulations: Select note, double-click palette item
- Pedal: Lines → Pedal

**Formatting**:
- Format → Style → adjust spacing
- Add page breaks: select barline → break icon
- Title/composer: File → Score Properties

### Phase 4: Final Export

**PDF settings**:
1. File → Export → PDF
2. Resolution: 300 DPI (print quality)
3. Page size: Letter (US) or A4 (international)

**Review checklist**:
- [ ] All pages readable
- [ ] Page turns at sensible positions
- [ ] Title and credits visible
- [ ] No notation collisions
- [ ] Playable by a pianist

**Save MuseScore project**:
- File → Save As → .mscz format
- This is your editable source for future changes

## Tips for Better Results

### Audio Quality

**Better source = better transcription**:
- Use mastered WAV (not MP3)
- Ensure track is not clipping
- Clear, well-mixed audio transcribes better

### Track Selection

**Transcribes well**:
- Solo vocals with simple accompaniment
- Acoustic folk/singer-songwriter
- Clear melody-driven pop
- Piano-based songs

**Challenging**:
- Dense rock with multiple guitars
- Electronic music with synth pads
- Songs with heavy distortion
- Rapid-fire rap vocals

### Piano Reduction Philosophy

**Goal**: Playable arrangement that captures the song's essence

**Approach**:
- Melody in right hand (usually)
- Bass line + harmony in left hand
- Simplify complex passages
- Don't try to transcribe everything

**What to keep**:
- Main melody
- Bass line
- Characteristic riffs/hooks
- Harmonic structure

**What to simplify/omit**:
- Drum patterns
- Doubled/layered parts
- Complex background vocals
- Sound effects

---

## Stem Separation (Advanced)

For complex tracks, separating stems first can dramatically improve accuracy.

### Using Demucs

**Install**:
```bash
pip install demucs
```

**Run separation**:
```bash
demucs /path/to/track.wav
```

**Output** (in `separated/htdemucs/track/`):
- `vocals.wav` - isolated vocals
- `drums.wav` - percussion
- `bass.wav` - bass line
- `other.wav` - everything else (guitars, synths, etc.)

### Transcription Strategy with Stems

1. **Transcribe bass.wav** → bass clef part
2. **Transcribe other.wav** → treble clef part (melody, chords)
3. **Combine in MuseScore** → full piano reduction

**When to use**:
- Dense rock/pop arrangements
- Songs where melody is buried in mix
- Professional licensing needs (accuracy matters)

**When not needed**:
- Simple acoustic tracks
- Clear vocal + piano songs
- Quick reference transcriptions

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Transcription is a mess"

**Diagnose**: Too many overlapping instruments

**Fix**:
1. Lower sensitivity slider significantly
2. Focus on dominant melody only
3. Consider stem separation
4. Or: Accept this track isn't suitable for auto-transcription

### "Notes are in wrong octave"

**Diagnose**: AI confused by harmonics or low-quality audio

**Fix**:
1. Select notes in MuseScore
2. Ctrl/Cmd + Up/Down arrow to shift octave
3. Verify against original audio

### "Rhythm is incorrect"

**Diagnose**: Syncopation, swing, or complex timing confused the AI

**Fix**:
1. Listen to original while following transcription
2. Manually re-notate problem measures
3. Use MIDI playback to verify

### "Key signature is wrong"

**Diagnose**: AI detection isn't perfect, especially for modes

**Fix**:
1. Listen to original, identify correct key
2. In MuseScore: Edit → Key Signature
3. May need to transpose all notes if fundamentally wrong

### "Page turns are awkward"

**Fix in MuseScore**:
1. Select barline before desired page break
2. Add → Breaks & Spacers → Page Break
3. Or use Layout → Add/Remove System Breaks

## File Organization

### Storage Locations

**Released albums**:
```
artists/[artist]/released/[genre]/[album]/sheet-music/
```

**In-progress albums**:
```
artists/[artist]/albums/[genre]/[album]/sheet-music/
```

### Naming Convention

**Source files** (in `source/`):
```
01-track-name.pdf        # AnthemScore output
01-track-name.xml        # MusicXML source
01-track-name.mid        # MIDI file
```

**Singles** (in `singles/` — consumer-ready):
```
Track Name.pdf           # Clean-titled PDF
Track Name.xml           # Clean-titled MusicXML
Track Name.mid           # Clean-titled MIDI
.manifest.json           # Track ordering
```

### What to Keep

| File | Keep? | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| PDF | Yes | Publishing deliverable |
| .mscz | Yes | Source for future edits |
| .mid | Optional | Playback verification |
| .musicxml | Optional | Software interchange |
| Original WAV | Already have | In mastered/ folder |

## Publishing Considerations

### Copyright

- Sheet music is a derivative work
- You own copyright if you created the original song
- Include copyright notice on PDF: "© Year Artist Name"

### Licensing

**For sync licensing**:
- PDF sheet music can be included in licensing package
- Shows professionalism
- Useful for TV/film music supervisors

**For distribution**:
- Can sell sheet music separately (Sheet Music Plus, Musicnotes)
- Or include with album purchase
- Consider simplified vs. "as performed" versions

### Quality Expectations

**Professional standard**:
- Clean, readable notation
- Correct key/time signatures
- Appropriate dynamics and articulations
- Playable by intermediate pianist
- Proper credits and copyright

**Minimum viable**:
- Correct notes
- Readable layout
- Basic structure (verse, chorus labeled)
- Title and composer
