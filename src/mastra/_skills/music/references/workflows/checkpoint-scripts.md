# Checkpoint Scripts

This document contains the detailed example messages for workflow checkpoints. CLAUDE.md references these scripts but keeps only triggers and action lists for brevity.

## Ready to Generate Checkpoint

**Trigger**: When all track lyrics are written for an album

**Required Actions (before presenting to user):**
1. Review all track statuses — confirm every track has lyrics written
2. Verify Suno Style Box and Lyrics Box are filled in each track
3. Run `/bitwize-music:explicit-checker` on all tracks
4. Verify phonetic review: pronunciation tables complete, phonetic spellings applied in Suno lyrics
5. For source-based albums: confirm all sources are `✅ Verified`

**Say to user:**
```
✅ ALL LYRICS COMPLETE

Album: [name]
Tracks: [count] tracks written
Explicit: [Yes/No]
Sources: [All verified / X pending]

Ready to begin Suno generation?

Next steps:
1. You'll generate tracks on Suno using the Style/Lyrics boxes
2. Log each attempt in Generation Log
3. Mark tracks as "Generated" when you have keepers

Proceed to generation?
```

## Album Generation Complete Checkpoint

**Trigger**: When all tracks marked `Generated` with Suno Links

4. List all tracks with their status and links for the user

**Say to user:**

Ready for QA review?

Please listen through the full album:
1. Check vocal quality, pronunciation
2. Verify structure (all sections present)
3. Check for audio artifacts or issues
4. Confirm track order flows well

After QA, tell me:
- "Album approved" → Move to mastering
- "Track X needs regen" → We'll fix specific tracks
```

## Ready to Master Checkpoint

**Trigger**: User says "album approved" after QA review

**Required Actions (before presenting to user):**
1. Update all track statuses from `Generated` to `Final`
2. Update album status to `Complete`
3. Verify WAV files are downloaded from Suno (ask user if not confirmed)

**Say to user:**
```
✅ ALBUM APPROVED FOR MASTERING

All tracks marked Final. Album status: Complete.

Next step: Audio mastering

Do you have WAV files downloaded from Suno?
- If NO: Download all tracks as WAV (highest quality)
- If YES: Tell me where they're located

I'll set up mastering workflow once files are ready.
```
