# Promotion Preferences Override

## Default Settings

Override the plugin's default promotion settings for this artist/project.

### Video Generation
- **Default style:** pulse
  - Override: neon for dark electronic albums
  - Override: bars for high-energy rock
  - Override: line for acoustic/folk albums

- **Clip duration:** 15s
  - Override: 30s for ambient tracks (need longer build)
  - Override: 10s for punk/hardcore (short and punchy)

- **Sampler clips:** 12s each
  - Override: 8s for albums with 12+ tracks (fit in Twitter limit)
  - Override: 15s for albums with <6 tracks (more time per track)

### Platform Strategy

**Primary platforms:** Instagram Reels, Twitter
**Secondary platforms:** TikTok (manual upload later)
**Skip:** Facebook (older demographic, lower engagement)

**Posting schedule:**
- Pre-release (1 week): Album sampler
- Release day: Top 2 singles
- Week 1-2: Additional promos, spaced 2-3 days apart
- Ongoing: Reposts of best performers

### Album-Specific Overrides

**Dark electronic albums (industrial, techno):**
- Style: neon or pulse
- Duration: 15s (short attention span)
- Colors: Let auto-extraction work (usually gets good industrial colors)

**Ambient/chill albums:**
- Style: mirror or mountains
- Duration: 30s (longer build, meditative)
- Sampler: Skip (doesn't work for ambient, use individual promos only)

**Hip-hop albums:**
- Style: pulse or bars
- Duration: 15s (hook-focused)
- Sampler: Include (great for showcasing variety)

**True-story concept albums:**
- Style: pulse (professional, journalistic feel)
- Add text overlay: "Based on true events" (not in base script, manual edit)
- Duration: 30s (give time for story context)

### Branding Preferences

**Artist name display:**
- Position: Bottom center (current default is good)
- Font size: 48pt (current default)
- Override: None needed

**Title display:**
- Position: Bottom center, above artist name
- Font size: 64pt (current default)
- Override: 72pt for single-word titles (more impact)

**Track number display:**
- Show: No (current default)
- Override: Yes for concept albums with narrative arc

**Album name in video:**
- Include: No (not in current script)
- Future: Add for non-single releases

### Color Schemes

**Let auto-extraction work** unless artwork has problematic colors:
- Too dark (extraction fails): Use manual color override
- Too washed out: Increase saturation in artwork before generating
- Wrong mood: Consider different style (some styles don't use artwork colors)

**Manual overrides** (future feature):
- Dark albums: Force white/cyan waveform regardless of artwork
- Bright pop: Use extracted colors (usually works great)
- Monochrome artwork: Force complementary color wheel

### Quality Standards

**Before publishing any promo video:**
- [ ] Waveform reacts clearly to audio
- [ ] Title and artist name readable on phone screen
- [ ] Artwork visible and sharp (not too obscured)
- [ ] Colors match album aesthetic and mood
- [ ] First frame is compelling (auto-play thumbnail)
- [ ] Audio levels consistent across all promos

**Test on phone before batch-generating entire album.**

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Instagram Reels:**
- Prefer pulse, neon, or bars (high energy)
- 15-30s optimal (longer gets lower watch-through rate)
- First 3 seconds critical (loop point)

**Twitter:**
- Prefer pulse or colorwave (professional)
- Sampler performs well (full album preview)
- 15s individual promos for singles

**TikTok:**
- Prefer bars or neon (gen-z aesthetic)
- 15s only (30s+ gets skipped)
- Higher energy styles

### Workflow Notes

**When I say "generate promos"** without specifying style:
- Use default from this document for the album genre
- Generate both individual + sampler unless I specify otherwise
- Use pulse if genre isn't listed here

**When I say "quick test":**
- Generate only one video (first track)
- Use pulse style
- 15s duration
- Check quality before batch-generating rest

**When I say "Instagram-ready":**
- Generate individual promos only (skip sampler)
- Use high-energy style (pulse, neon, bars)
- 15s duration
- Verify on phone before publishing

## Social Media Copy Preferences

These settings are used by `/bitwize-music:promo-writer` when generating social media copy.

### Tone & Voice
- **Default tone**: casual | professional | hype | mysterious | storytelling
- **Emoji usage**: none | minimal | moderate | heavy
- **Point of view**: first-person ("I made...") | third-person ("bitwize releases...") | collective ("We made...")

### Platform Priorities
Ordered list of platforms to generate copy for. Remove platforms to skip them.
1. Twitter/X
2. Instagram
3. TikTok
4. Facebook
5. YouTube

### Messaging Themes
**Always mention**: Topics to weave into copy (e.g., "the story behind the album", "the creative process")
**Never mention**: Topics to avoid (e.g., "personal struggles", "competing artists")

### Hashtag Preferences
**Always include**: Tags for every post (platform limits permitting)
**Genre tags**: Override genre tag selection from copy-formulas.md
**Avoid**: Tags to never use (e.g., #FollowBack, #Like4Like, #MusicPromotion)

### AI Music Positioning
- **Mention AI**: never | occasionally (when relevant) | always
- **Framing**: How to describe the AI role (e.g., "AI-assisted artist")
- **Emphasis**: What to highlight about the human contribution (e.g., "creative direction, concept, curation")

## Example Override for Specific Artist

```markdown
# Promotion Preferences for "bitwize"

## Style Defaults by Genre

- **Industrial/Dark Electronic:** neon (bright against dark themes)
- **Glitch/Experimental:** circular or dual (abstract matches music)
- **Hip-Hop:** pulse (professional, clean)
- **Ambient:** mirror (meditative, symmetrical)

## Platform Strategy

Focus on Twitter and Instagram only. Skip TikTok (audience mismatch).

Post schedule:
- T-7 days: Sampler + "New album in 7 days"
- T-0 (release): Top single + streaming link
- T+2: Second single
- T+5: Deep cut from album
- T+7: Repost sampler + "Out now"

## Branding

- Keep artist name lowercase: "bitwize" not "Bitwize"
- Prefer dark backgrounds (matches aesthetic)
- Let color extraction work (usually gets good results)

## Quality Gates

Before publishing:
- [ ] Test on phone (desktop looks different)
- [ ] Waveform visible and reactive
- [ ] Text readable at phone size
- [ ] First frame compelling (dark + vivid waveform)
- [ ] Matches album aesthetic
```

- Per-track style overrides (different styles per track on album)
- Custom color palettes (force specific hex colors)
- Text overlay templates (captions, quotes, lyrics)
- Branding overlays (logos, watermarks)
- Platform-specific variations (different styles per platform)
