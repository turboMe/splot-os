| **Clipping** | Distortion caused by audio exceeding maximum level (0 dBFS). Prevented by true peak limiting. | Audio sounds harsh/crunchy at peaks |
| **Crest Factor** | Difference between peak and RMS levels, indicating dynamic range. High crest factor = more dynamics. | Crest factor > 12dB may need compression |
| **dBFS** | Decibels Full Scale. Measures audio level where 0 is the maximum digital value. | Peak at -3 dBFS |
| **dBTP** | Decibels True Peak. Maximum sample value accounting for inter-sample peaks. Target: -1.0 dBTP for streaming. | `--ceiling -1.0` |
| **Dry Run** | Preview mode that shows what processing would be applied without writing files. | `--dry-run` flag |
| **Dynamic Range** | Difference between quietest and loudest parts of audio. Classical has high DR; compressed pop has low DR. | LUFS Range < 2 dB across album |
| **Genre Preset** | Pre-configured EQ and dynamics settings for specific genres in mastering tools. 60+ available. | `--genre country`, `--genre hip-hop` |
| **High-Mid Cut** | EQ reduction in 2-6kHz range to reduce harshness/tinniness. Common mastering correction. | `--cut-highmid -2` for 2dB cut at 3.5kHz |
| **LUFS** | Loudness Units Full Scale. Measures perceived loudness. Streaming platforms normalize to -14 LUFS. | Target: -14 LUFS for Spotify |

| **Normalization** | Adjusting audio levels to meet a target loudness. LUFS normalization ensures consistent playback. | Normalize to -14 LUFS |
| **Reference Mastering** | Matching a track's tonal balance and loudness to a professionally mastered reference track. | Match to a commercial release in same genre |
| **Tinniness** | Harsh, thin sound quality caused by excessive high-mid frequencies (2-6kHz). Common in AI-generated audio. | High-mid ratio > 0.6 indicates tinniness |
| **True Peak** | Maximum absolute sample value, including inter-sample peaks. Different from sample peak. | True peak at -1.0 dBTP prevents streaming clipping |

## Commonly Confused Terms

| Terms | Clarification |
|-------|---------------|
| **Album Ideas vs Album Status** | Album Ideas (`IDEAS.md`) are brainstorming before creation. Album Status (README field) tracks progress of created albums. |
| **Content Root vs Audio Root** | Content Root has markdown files (lyrics, track docs). Audio Root has WAV files. Both use the mirrored structure with artist and genre folders. |
| **Master (file) vs Master (process)** | Master (file) = the final processed audio file. Master (process) = the act of processing audio for release. |
| **Plugin Root vs Content Root** | Plugin Root contains code/templates (don't edit). Content Root contains your albums/lyrics (edit freely). |
| **Project vs Album** | "Project" is not used in this plugin. Use "Album" for a collection of tracks being released together. |
| **Song vs Track** | Interchangeable in this plugin. Both refer to a single piece of music. |
| **Style Prompt vs Style Box** | Same thing. "Style prompt" is what you write; "Style Box" is where it goes in Suno. |
| **Suno Link vs Suno URL** | Interchangeable. Both refer to the URL of a generated track. Prefer "Suno Link" in track files. |
| **Workspace vs Content Root** | "Workspace" is informal. Use "Content Root" for the specific directory defined in config. |
