# Pronunciation Guide for Suno Lyrics

Suno's text-to-speech engine can mispronounce words, especially homographs (same spelling, different pronunciation) and technical terms. This guide helps identify problem words and provides solutions.

> **Related skill**: `/bitwize-music:pronunciation-specialist` (automated scanning for pronunciation risks)
> **Related docs**: [v5-best-practices.md](v5-best-practices.md)

## Why This Matters

Suno reads lyrics literally. It doesn't understand context the way humans do. When it sees "live," it picks one pronunciation — and it might be wrong for your meaning.

**V5 Note**: V5 improved context sensitivity for pronunciation, but our rule stands: **never trust context for homographs**. The improvement is incremental, not reliable enough to skip phonetic spelling.

**IPA Note**: IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) is **not natively supported** by Suno despite community requests. Use the phonetic spelling approaches documented below instead.

**Example**: "LiveJournal confessions" was sung as "LIV-journal" (like a live performance) instead of "LYVE-journal" (like alive).

## Homographs Reference

Words spelled the same but pronounced differently depending on meaning.

### Acronyms & Initialisms

#### Suno-Specific Spelling for Correct Pronunciation

Some terms need special spelling in lyrics to get Suno to pronounce them correctly:

| Term | Correct Pronunciation | Write As | Notes |
|------|----------------------|----------|-------|
| GNU | "guh-NEW" (hard G) | **guh-new** | Without this, Suno may say "G-N-U" or "new" |
| Debian | "DEB-ee-un" | **Deb-Ian** | Hyphen ensures three syllables |

#### Letter-by-Letter Acronyms

Use periods between letters to force Suno to spell them out:
- **S.L.S.** not "SLS"
- **L.K.M.L.** not "LKML"
- **B.D.F.L.** not "BDFL"
- **D.F.S.G.** not "DFSG"
- **A.P.I.** not "API"

Without periods, Suno may try to pronounce letter-acronyms as words.

| Term | Pronunciation | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| SQL | "sequel" or "S-Q-L" | Both used, "sequel" more common |

## Fixes & Workarounds

### Option 1: Rewrite (Preferred)

Find alternative phrasing that avoids the problem word entirely.

**Before**: "LiveJournal confessions in abandoned rooms"
**After**: "Old blog confessions in abandoned rooms"

**Before**: "I read your message yesterday"
**After**: "I saw your message yesterday"

### Option 2: Phonetic Spelling

Write the word how it sounds. Looks weird in lyrics but works.

| Original | Phonetic | Use When |
|----------|----------|----------|
| LiveJournal | Life-journal | Brand pronunciation critical |
| read (past) | red | Past tense ambiguous |
| lead (metal) | led | Metal meaning needed |
| wound (coil) | wownd | Coil meaning needed |
| live (alive) | lyve | Alive/living meaning (rhymes with "five") |
| live (performance) | liv | Live show/broadcast meaning (rhymes with "give") |

### Option 3: Hyphenation

Break syllables to guide pronunciation. Can help with sustained notes too.

| Original | Hyphenated | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| live (alive) | li-ive | Forces long 'i' |
| read (present) | ree-ead | Forces long 'e' |
| wind (coil) | wi-ind | Forces long 'i' |

### Option 4: Context Padding

Add words that make the pronunciation obvious.

**Before**: "Live broadcast from the scene"
**After**: "Broadcasting live from the scene" (verb form clearer)

**Before**: "The lead singer"
**After**: "Leading the band" (verb form avoids ambiguity)

### Option 5: Accept It

Sometimes the mispronunciation isn't jarring enough to matter, or there's no good fix. Document the risk and move on.

## Pronunciation Table Enforcement Workflow

The Pronunciation Notes table in each track file is a **mandatory checklist**, not passive documentation. Every entry MUST be applied as phonetic spelling in the Suno Lyrics Box.

### Process

1. **Before finalizing any track**: Read the Pronunciation Notes table top to bottom
2. **For each entry**: Search the Suno Lyrics Box for the standard spelling
3. **Replace** with the phonetic version from the table
4. **Verify** every occurrence is fixed — check all verses, choruses, bridges, and outros
5. **Common failure**: Word added to table but never applied to lyrics, or phonetic in one verse but missed in chorus/bridge

### Verification Format

After applying all phonetics, document verification:

```markdown
| Word | Standard | Phonetic | Applied? |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Ramos | Ramos | Rah-mohs | ✓ All 4 occurrences |
| live | live | lyve | ✓ V1, V2, Chorus |
| FBI | FBI | F-B-I | ✓ Bridge |
```

### Rules

- The table is the source of truth — if it says phonetic, the Suno lyrics MUST use phonetic
- Streaming/distributor lyrics always keep standard English spelling
- When adding a new word to the table, immediately apply it to all Suno lyrics
- Run this check as the final step before generation, after all other edits are complete

## Numbers

Always **spell out numbers** in Suno lyrics — Suno handles written-out numbers more reliably than digits.

| Write | Not |
|-------|-----|
| twenty-one | 21 |
| nineteen eighty-four | 1984 |
| three hundred | 300 |

**Exception**: Year abbreviations like `'93` work well and avoid the "ninety-three" producer tag filter issue.

---

## Multilingual Tracks

For songs with lyrics in multiple languages:

- **Use one language per section** — mixing languages within a section causes pronunciation drift
- Add `all lyrics in [language], no English` to the style prompt for non-English sections to prevent the model reverting to English
- V5 improved multilingual fluency, but section isolation remains the most reliable approach

**Example**:
```
[Verse 1 - Spanish]
Spanish lyrics here...

[Chorus - English]
English chorus here...
```

Style prompt: Include both language indicators: "bilingual, Spanish verse, English chorus"

---

## German Pronunciation

Suno interprets German vowels using English phonetic rules, which causes specific mispronunciations. These fixes apply to **all German-language lyrics**, regardless of genre.

### Short vs Long Vowels

Suno treats single German vowels as short English vowels. To force the correct long German pronunciation, **double the vowel**.

| German Word | Suno Reads As | Fix | Why |
|-------------|---------------|-----|-----|
| juchhe | "juch-heh" (short e) | **juchee** | Double-e forces long "ee" sound |
| Schnee | "schneh" (short e) | **Schnee** (usually OK) | Double-e already present |
| See | "seh" (short e) | **See** (usually OK) | Double-e already present |

**Rule of thumb**: If a German word ends in a single vowel that should be long, double it for Suno. Test by generating — if the vowel sounds clipped, double it.

### German Umlauts

Suno handles umlauts inconsistently. Test first, fix if needed.

| Character | Suno Behavior | Fix If Wrong |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| ä | Sometimes reads as "a" | Use "ae" |
| ö | Sometimes reads as "o" | Use "oe" |
| ü | Sometimes reads as "u" | Use "ue" |
| ß | Usually reads as "ss" | Usually OK |

### German Interjections

Common German exclamations that Suno may mispronounce:

| Word | Expected | Suno Risk | Fix |
|------|----------|-----------|-----|
| juchhe | "juch-HEE" | Short clipped "heh" | **juchee** |
| juhu | "yoo-HOO" | May stress wrong syllable | Usually OK |
| hurra | "hoo-RAH" | Usually OK | — |
| ach | "ahh" (guttural) | May say "atch" | Usually OK |
| oho | "oh-HOH" | Usually OK | — |

## Quick Reference Card

```
HIGH-RISK WORDS (always check):
live, read, lead, wind, close, tear, bow, bass, wound

TECH TERMS (verify pronunciation):
- Compound brands: LiveJournal, YouTube, GitHub
- Acronyms: SQL, GUI, GIF, IEEE, ASCII
- Tech words: Linux, cache, daemon, router

FIX PRIORITY:
1. Rewrite (different word)
2. Phonetic spelling (looks weird, works)
3. Hyphenation (break syllables)
4. Context padding (add clarifying words)
5. Accept (document and move on)

DOCUMENT RISKS:
Add "Pronunciation Risks" section to Production Notes
if a word can't be fixed but might mispronounce.
```

## Accent Simulation

Suno doesn't have direct accent controls, but you can simulate accents:

### Technique

1. **Rewrite lyrics phonetically** as spoken in target accent
   - NOT dictionary spelling
   - Spell words as they sound in the accent

2. **Add accent name to style box**
   - Example: "Russian accent"
   - Example: "Jamaican accent"
   - Example: "Southern drawl"

3. **Use ChatGPT for conversion** (optional)
   - Prompt: "Rewrite these lyrics phonetically for a [accent] accent"

### Examples

**Standard**: "I'm going to the store"
**Russian accent**: "Ahm go-ink to da store"
**Jamaican accent**: "Mi ah go ah di store"
**Southern US**: "Ahm goin' to tha store"

**Note**: Results vary by accent complexity. Simple accents (Russian, Irish) work better than complex regional dialects.

---

## Testing

When in doubt:
1. Say the line out loud both ways
2. Ask: "If Suno picks wrong, is the song ruined?"
3. If yes, fix it. If no, document and move on.
