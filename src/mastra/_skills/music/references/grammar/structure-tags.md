# Suno Structure Tags Reference

Complete reference for song structure tags in Suno lyrics.

## Basic Structure Tags

### Intro
```
[Intro]
```
**Note**: The `[Intro]` tag is notoriously unreliable. Better alternatives:
```
[Short Instrumental Intro]
[Intro - Spoken]
```

### Verse
```
[Verse]
[Verse 1]
[Verse 2]
[Catchy Verse]
```

### Chorus
```
[Chorus]
[Catchy Hook]
```

### Bridge
```
[Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
```

### Instrumental Sections
```
[Break]
[Interlude]
[Guitar Solo Interlude]
[Percussion Break]
[melodic interlude]
```

### Endings
```
[Outro]
[End]
[Fade Out]
[Fade to End]
[Big Finish]
[Refrain]
```

## Custom Mood/Style Tags

These descriptive tags influence delivery:

```
[Shout]          - Aggressive, shouted delivery
[Whimsical]      - Playful, light tone
[Melancholy]     - Sad, reflective mood
[Spoken]         - Spoken word, not sung
[Whispered]      - Quiet, intimate
[Energetic]      - High energy delivery
```

## Example Song Structure

### Basic Pop/Rock Structure
```
[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
First verse lyrics...

[Chorus]
Hook lyrics...

[Verse 2]
Second verse lyrics...

[Chorus]
Hook lyrics...

[Bridge]

[Outro]

[Fade Out]
```

### Hip-Hop Structure
```
[Intro - Spoken]
Intro spoken word...

[Verse 1]
First verse...

[Chorus]
Hook...

[Verse 2]
Second verse...

[Chorus]
Hook...

[Verse 3]
Third verse...

[Outro]

[End]
```

### Punk Structure (Short & Fast)
```
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Fast verse...

[Chorus]
Shout-along chorus...

[Verse 2]
Fast verse...

[Chorus]
Shout-along chorus...

[Break]

[Chorus]
Final chorus...

[Big Finish]
```

## Bar Count Targeting (V5)

V5 supports targeting specific bar counts per section by adding numbers after tags:

```
[INTRO 4] [VERSE 1 8] [PRE 4] [CHORUS 8] [VERSE 2 8] [PRE 4] [CHORUS 8] [BRIDGE 8] [CHORUS 8] [OUTRO 4]
```

Numbers represent target bar counts. Results are approximate — Suno treats them as guidance, not strict limits. Useful for controlling intro/outro length and balancing section proportions.

## Performance Cues

Add **1–3 performance cues per section** to influence delivery without overloading:

```
[Verse 1 - quiet, intimate]
Lyrics here...

[Chorus - building, anthemic]
Lyrics here...

[Bridge - raw, exposed]
Lyrics here...
```

**Rule**: More than 3 cues per section causes noise. Keep it focused.

## Tag Reliability Notes

V5 improved tag reliability significantly over V4/V4.5. Tags that were inconsistent in earlier versions now produce more predictable results.

### Reliable Tags
- `[Verse]`, `[Verse 1]`, etc.
- `[Chorus]`
- `[End]`
- `[Fade Out]`
- `[Pre-Chorus]` (improved in V5)

### Moderately Reliable
- `[Bridge]`
- `[Break]`
- `[Outro]`

### Less Reliable
- `[Intro]` - Use descriptive alternatives
- Custom tags - Results vary

## Tips

1. **Use numbered verses** (`[Verse 1]`, `[Verse 2]`) for clarity
2. **Keep intros short** to prevent burying vocals
3. **Combine tags with descriptions**: `[Soft Verse]`, `[Building Chorus]`
4. **End explicitly** with `[End]` or `[Fade Out]` for clean endings
5. **Test variations** - tag effectiveness varies by genre/model
