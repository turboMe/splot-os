/**
 * AuthorClaw Disclosures Service
 *
 * Enforces legal + platform disclosure requirements before any AI-generated
 * content gets uploaded anywhere. Every Wave 3 service calls this to get
 * the required disclosure strings + hard-gate checks for a given action.
 *
 * This is NOT a substitute for legal advice. It encodes published platform
 * requirements and widely-reported regulations as of 2026. Rules change —
 * authors are ultimately responsible for compliance.
 *
 * Covers:
 *   - ACX / Audible / Apple Books / Google Play / Spotify — AI narration
 *   - Amazon KDP — AI-generated content disclosure
 *   - European Union AI Act — transparency for AI-generated content
 *   - France (Code de la consommation Art. L.111-1) — AI-translated works
 *   - DMCA / copyright — scraped review quote attribution
 *   - FTC — affiliate link disclosure on author websites
 *   - GDPR / CAN-SPAM — reader list handling
