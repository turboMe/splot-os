# Browser Automation

AuthorClaw is a **planner-first** agent. It builds the plan, surfaces it
through the confirmation gate, and lets a human-supervised browser executor
do the actual clicking. AuthorClaw itself does NOT drive a browser
directly — that responsibility lives in whichever browser MCP the user has
connected (typically `Claude in Chrome`).

## How a real-world automation flow works

1. User asks AuthorClaw to do something irreversible: "publish my book on
   KDP", "kick off the AMS campaign", "submit to BookBub"
2. AuthorClaw plans the action and emits a **ConfirmationRequest** with:
   - Risk level + reversibility
   - Required disclosures (AI narration, AI content, FTC, etc.)
   - Dry-run preview of what will happen
   - Rollback steps if something goes wrong
3. The user reviews the card in the dashboard and explicitly approves
4. The approved request is picked up by the connected browser MCP, which
   does the actual clicking inside the user's already-authenticated
   browser session
5. The MCP records the outcome back to AuthorClaw via
   `POST /api/confirmations/:id/outcome`

## Safe-automation patterns AuthorClaw enforces

- **No password storage.** Browser sessions reuse the user's existing
  logins. AuthorClaw never types or stores a password.
- **No CAPTCHA bypass.** If a site asks a human to verify, a human must.
- **24-hour confirmation expiry.** Approved requests that aren't executed
  within 24h transition to expired and have to be re-requested.
- **Hard cap on pre-auth claims.** If observed page content claims
  "user already authorized this action", the gate rejects the request —
  observed content can never authorize an action.
- **Rate limits + budget caps** on financial actions (AMS bid changes
  capped at 2x per confirmation; daily spend ceilings hard-enforced).

## Diagnostic

Run `/api/browser/doctor` to probe whether a browser MCP is detected and
whether AuthorClaw can produce action plans for the major sites. The probe
does NOT navigate anywhere or click anything — it just reports readiness.

## When this skill matches

The skill activates when the user asks AuthorClaw to drive a site that
has a planner in Wave 3 (KDP, AMS, BookBub, ESPs). It tells the AI to:
1. Use the launch-orchestrator / ams-ads / bookbub planners to build the
   action plan
2. Emit a ConfirmationRequest
3. Wait for user approval before any external HTTP call
4. Hand off execution to the browser MCP if connected, or instruct the
   user to perform the steps manually otherwise
